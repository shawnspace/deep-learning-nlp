A comprehensive survey of deep learning applications in NLP

Two papers are included: 
1. A Primer on Neural Network Models for Natural Language Processing (Goldberg Y. A Primer on Neural Network Models for Natural Language Processing[J]. J. Artif. Intell. Res.(JAIR), 2016, 57: 345-420.)

This paper describe major concepts in deep learning: MLP, bp algorithm, neural network training technology include dropout, batch norm and regularization, loss function, CNN, RNN, LSTM, Recursive Neural  Networn and word embedding. It is a good introduction to deep learning and basic applications of deep learning in NLP.

2. Recent Trends in Deep Learning Based Natural Language Processing (Young T, Hazarika D, Poria S, et al. Recent trends in deep learning based natural language processing[J]. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.02709, 2017.)

This paper gives a comprehensive survey of state-of-art deep learning in NLP. Topics inlude: word embedding, CNN, RNN, Recursive Neural Network, reinforced models, unsupervised models include GAN, memory augmented network and their apllications in NLP tasks. Those NLP tasks include: Word Segmentation, POS tagging, Named Entity recognition, Dependency parsing, Classification, Language Modeling, Natural Language Generation, Image Caption, QA, Machine Translation, Dialogue and Sentiment analysis.
